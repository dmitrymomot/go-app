# DTO

DTO stands for Data Transfer Object. It is a design pattern used in software development to transfer data between different layers of an application or between different applications. 

DTOs are typically used to encapsulate data and provide a simple interface for transferring data between different components of an application, such as between the presentation layer and the business layer. They allow for the separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.

DTOs typically contain only data and do not contain any business logic or behavior. They are often used to represent complex data structures, such as database records or XML documents, in a simpler form that can be easily transferred between components.

In addition to simplifying data transfer, DTOs can also improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between components. By only transferring the necessary data, DTOs can help reduce network traffic and improve application responsiveness.
